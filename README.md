# Andrew Ham - Personal Website

Welcome to my personal website! Here you can view the projects I have created and how to contact me.
I created my dyanmic website using ReactJS styled with CSS! The website UI is optimised for phone screen as well using media query breakpoints!

## :computer: Tech Stacks / breakdown
Whilst creating this website I used/learned the following
- ReactJS and CSS
- React Conditionals
- Best file/folder structure practice (I organised my file/folder structures the best I could to follow the best practices).
- React components (learning how to re use components such as my project card - displaying each project through use of components. Created local API without backend so we can dynamically pass data and display it)
- Deploying a website using Netlify
- Use of Mailgun to receive email when user fills out contact form!

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.


### Deployment

I deployed my website using Netlify!
